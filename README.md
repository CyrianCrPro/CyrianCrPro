# Hi, I'm Cyrian! 👾

I'm passionate about emerging technologies, particularly artificial intelligence, and I'm committed to driving innovation in the tech industry. **I am currently looking for a 5/6 months internship as an AI Engineer and/or Data Analyst/Scientist.** 🌍💻

Throughout my journey, I've built a variety of projects using different languages and frameworks. Feel free to dive into some of my work in Python, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and more. Each project showcases my commitment to solving problems or discovering new technologies. ✨
